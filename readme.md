The lectures that we had prior to this lab were extremely beneficial in being both a learning opportunity and
a resource for future web maps. I very much enjoyed the freedom of choosing between two map styles and any
topic of our liking. The only part that I had legitimate issues with was trying to add popups to each
proportional circle. I must admit that my map would not be ready to release to the public. I was not able
to figure out how to do popups or a legend in the time alloted for this lab. As it stands, my map will tell
the use the information relative to other states, but not with any real information. My goal is to master
popups by the end of this class.
